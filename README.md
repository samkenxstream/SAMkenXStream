# Sam Ken

 I am a software developer learner. I have a passion learning for creating efficient and effective web applicatiion.I lrsrned few understanding of object-oriented programming principles. I have cautiously tried  several different web technologies, such as HTML, CSS, HTTP, Android, NL, Python, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, Node.js, 

 I am a learner team player and have tried both small and large teams. I am comfortable learning independently and am willing to take on challenges.

 I am always searching for ways to improve my skills and stay up to date with the latest web technologies. I enjoy learning new technologies and am always eager to try new things.
